## Sprite Shading Characteristics

**Light Source and Shading**


- Most sprites use 3-4 shading levels
- Typically have 1 base color, 1 shade color, and 1 light color per area
- Occasionally use a 2nd shade color for special or dark areas
- Faces LEFT, with light coming from the  top left creating a shadow below the bud

## Color and Shading Techniques

- **Color Palette**: Expanded to 16 unique colors in Generation 3 (up from 4 in previous generations)
- Shading follows the **curvature of the Pokémon's body**
- Shadows are placed where light does not directly hit
- Highlights are positioned to create a sense of depth and dimensionality
- Outlines are typically black or dark, with slight color variations to create depth

## Artistic Principles

- Avoid overly complex shading
- Use colors to highlight details rather than adding too many lines
- Maintain clean base colors
- Create a sense of roundness and volume through strategic shading
- Aim for a balance between simplicity and detail
