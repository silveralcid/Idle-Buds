Redesign:
- theme to dark-ish fantasy instead of cute cute
- EXPLORING AND BEATING COMBAT UNLOCKS RESOURCE NODES THAT, so theyre locked until you manage to get pass the area requirements
- each "activity" once unlocked allows for one bud to work, upgrades to assign more, prob up to 3-5
- Droppable TMs

## General Systems

### Bud

| Forms         | Requirements                    | % of Max Stat Awarded |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Baby Form     | N/A                             | 1.0                   |
| 1st Phase     | Level 14-35                     | 1.15                  |
| 2nd Phase     | Level 34-55                     | 1.30                  |
| 3rd Phase     | Level 54-75                     | 1.50                  |
| Ascended Form | Level 100, Unique Condition Per | -                     |
- To evolve, bud must spend X hours at an Evolution Shrine
- Current phase affects how much stat a bud can gain per level
- Each phase unlocks new move availability

### Hunters
- Level from 1-100 in every activity
- Gains attribute points to spend on stats at every level
### Evolution Shrine
- Buds of the same affinity can boo

In order to evolve, buds need to be placed in an evolution shrine for X hours. There will be ways to shorten the length of time, minimum and maximum needs to be set.

### Eggs
- Buds cannot be caught, eggs drop as loot and they must be hatched*
- Kindling buds can boost efficiency
- Eggs must be placed in the hatchery for X hours to hatch. There will be ways to shorten the length of time, minimum and maximum needs to be set.

## Items

### Tiers
- 8 normal tiers
- 1 ascended tier
- Resources and Items are symmetrical
### Equipment
- Requires a minimum level and relevant stat
- Has elemental bonuses like buds
- Has stat range, so they are always unique* NOT FOR PROTOTYPE

#### Equipment Stats


### Bud Crafting/Gathering Skills
Buds do not have individual skill levels for tasks like tamers do, instead their work efficiency is determined by their stats, which is determined by level, IVs, and etc. Passions provide a boost to this.

Buds task ability depends on species, effectiveness depends on affinity and passion

Buds are not able to unlock resource nodes themselves, these must be unlocked by the player.

Buds are able to work on resource nodes without players once unlocked.


## Affinity System

### Intrinsic Values
- 0-100 range for normal buds
- Rare+ buds have minimum ranges that are progressively higher per tier

### Stat Growth
- Base stats increase with level (1-100)
- Equipment provides stat bonuses
- Intrinsic Values provide extra stat increase per level
### Passion System
- Each Bud has specific work passions
- Ranges from 1-5, does not change, there is a minimum level for certain species but you can catch at a range

- Affects efficiency in tasks
- Passions are:
	- Aquatics (Watering, Fishing)
	- Kindling (Smelting, Cooking)
	- Gathering (Lumbering, Mining)
	- Handiwork (Smithing, Crafting)
	- Combat
Task Passions 
- Buds typically have primary and secondary task passion
- Some Buds are specialists (one high-level task passion)
- Others are generalists (multiple lower-level task passion)
- Rare Buds have unique task passions
Buds with Gathering passion can do both lumbering and mining, but their affinity will provide a massive boost depending on task, i.e. grass

# Executive Summary
## Game Concept and Vision

Idle Buds reimagines the monster-taming genre through an innovative idle progression system, creating a unique blend of passive gameplay and active strategy. As a Bud Tamer, players discover and nurture a diverse collection of Buds - mystical creatures that evolve and grow even while offline. The game transforms traditional taming mechanics into an engaging idle experience where your Buds autonomously battle, gather resources, and develop new abilities.

At its core, Idle Buds offers deep strategic elements through team composition and Bud development, while maintaining accessibility through automated progression systems. Players can customize their Buds' traits, abilities, and equipment, creating unique combinations for different challenges.

The game features an expansive ecosystem where Buds work together in various activities - from resource gathering and crafting to battling wild Buds and challenging boss encounters. Your collection of Buds continues to grow and evolve while you're away, with each Bud having distinct roles in your growing sanctuary.

Idle Buds maintains the core appeal of monster-taming games while eliminating the traditional grind. The automated systems handle the repetitive aspects, allowing players to focus on strategic decisions and collection goals. Whether actively playing or letting your Buds progress independently, the game provides meaningful advancement through its multi-layered progression system, special events, and achievement-based unlocks that enhance your idle efficiency.
