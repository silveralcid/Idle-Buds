 Instead of having a single universal shop menu (like Melvor), create location-based shops and special resource nodes that players need to "discover" or "unlock" in different areas. 
- EXPLORING AND BEATING COMBAT UNLOCKS RESOURCE NODES THAT, so theyre locked until you manage to get pass the area requirements
- each "activity" once unlocked allows for one bud to work, upgrades to assign more, prob up to 3-5
- Droppable TMs
- Mix and match crafting materials for unique equipment, deep crafting system
- buds have unique affects and chances on equipment type
