## Idle Buds - Collect, Train, & Dominate!

### Inspiration  
Inspired by the charm of creature-collecting adventures and the convenience of idle progression games, *Idle Buds* combines the best of both worlds. Drawing influence from timeless RPG mechanics, we envisioned a world where strategy, resource management, and exciting battles meet the joy of nurturing and evolving unique creatures—Buds.

### What Idle Buds is All About
*Idle Buds* offers a unique gameplay experience where you:  
- **Collect**: Gather rare eggs, hatch them into adorable and powerful Buds, and explore different regions.
- **Train**: Level up Buds, unlock evolutions, and specialize their abilities based on affinities and stats.  
- **Dominate**: Strategically assign Buds to gather resources, craft gear, and defeat bosses to progress through the adventure.  

Through careful balancing of Bud affinities, passions, and ascension mechanics, we created a deep yet accessible idle game. With idle mechanics and active progression, you can play at your own pace while achieving rewarding milestones.

### How We Built It  
We crafted *Idle Buds* using:  
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for modular, scalable UI and Tailwind CSS for streamlined design.  
- **Backend**: AWS services like DynamoDB for data management and S3 for storage.  
- **Amazon Q**: Amazon Q allowed this solo developer to progress at an unimaginable speed. From laying the foundation of the game to designing the architecture, debugging errors, and exploring entirely new features, Amazon Q served as an invaluable partner.
